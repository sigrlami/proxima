# Proxima

Rust-based library that allow N-dimensional proximity search for points in dimension or multiple dimensions that are close to a specified point.

This type of proximity search can be used for many different areas, usually used to build up recomendation services in modern web platforms. Those type of algorithms not entirely perfect in terms of the overlaps but good enough to be useful in different environment setups.


## Performance Benching

We do performance benching over a set of readily avilable libraries to  showcase rust as good option for writing typed and performat softwares.

Planned comparsion to:

* [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)
* [FLANN](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html): LSHForest, KDTree, BallTree
* [PANNS](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/panns)
* [NearPy](http://pixelogik.github.io/NearPy/)
* [KGraph](https://github.com/aaalgo/kgraph)
